# SampleGraph

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.6.

The library for the chart is `NgxApexChart` with `radialBarChart` but still in progress for customization

The main code folder is the inside `sample-graph` folder

For easier to preview the code without setup and build, I have deployed it to vercel. You can check the link below

## Development server
Open Terminal

Run `cd sample-graph` to navigate to main code folder

Run `npm install --force` to install necessary packages.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
